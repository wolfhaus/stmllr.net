<section><h3>Prerequisites</h3>

	<p>I strongly suggest to use the <a href="http://www.raspbian.org/" title="Raspbian: Debian for Raspberry Pi"
										class="external-link">Raspbian distributio</a>n as operating system. It has
		built-in <a
				href="http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/545/does-the-raspberry-pi-have-hardware-floating-point-support"
				title="Hardware floating point support in Raspberry Pi" class="external-link">hardfloat support for the
			FPU</a> on your Raspberry Pi. This truly boosts performance for audio encodings. Without hardfloat support,
		you'll probably end up with 100% CPU usage. The result would be playback hickups and no fun at all.
	</p>

	<p>Icecast2 is a free audio streaming server which supporting the shoutcast protocol. MPD is a music player daemon
		which serves as a backend for playing audio. MPD uses the shoutcast library to stream to icecast2. Fortunately,
		Raspbian MPD is compiled with libshout and also mp3 support by default so we don't have to build any custom
		packages. MPC is a command line client to control MPD, for example to manage playlists or to start/stop playing
		a song.
	</p>

	<h3>Package installation</h3>

	<p>It's straighforward:
	</p>
	<pre>$ sudo aptitude install mpc mpd icecast2<br/>The following NEW packages will be installed:<br/>&nbsp; icecast2 libao-common libao4 libaudiofile1 libavahi-glib1 libavcodec53 libavformat53<br/>&nbsp; libavutil51 libcurl3-gnutls libdirac-encoder0 libfaad2 libgsm1 libjack-jackd2-0<br/>&nbsp; libmms0 libmp3lame0 libmpcdec6 libmpdclient2 libschroedinger-1.0-0 libshout3<br/>&nbsp; libspeex1 libtheora0 libva1 libvpx1 libwavpack1 libx264-123 libxvidcore4 mpc mpd</pre>
	<p>The package manager will ask you to configure Icecast2. You should do so and set a hostname and passwords for
		source, relay and administration. Needless to say to use strong passwords. The source password will be needed in
		the MPD configuration. (I used ICECAST_SOURCE_PASSWORD in the example)
	</p>

	<p>The autoconfiguration of the MPD package could report some warnings about ipv6 and tag_cache:
	</p>
	<pre>Setting up mpd (0.16.7-2) ...<br/>[....] Starting Music Player Daemon: mpd<br/>listen: bind to '[::1]:6600' failed: Failed to create socket: Address family not supported<br/>by protocol (continuing anyway, because binding to '127.0.0.1:6600' succeeded)<br/>Failed to load database: Failed to open database file &quot;/var/lib/mpd/tag_cache&quot;:<br/>No such file or directory</pre>
	<p>The tag_cache issue doesn't harm. The file will be added anyway and the warning will not appear again. This will
		hopefully be fixed by the package maintainer. The other issue relates to missing ipv6 network support. You
		probably need to load the ipv6 kernel module to get rid of this warning:
	</p>
	<pre>$ sudo modprobe ipv6</pre>
	<h3>Configuring MPD</h3>

	<p>A configuration set for the shout output needs to be added to /etc/mpd.conf
	</p>
	<pre>audio_output {<br/>&nbsp; type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;shout&quot;<br/>&nbsp; name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;RasPi MPD Stream&quot;<br/>&nbsp; description&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;MPD stream on Raspberry Pi&quot;<br/>&nbsp; host&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;localhost&quot;<br/>&nbsp; port&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;8000&quot;<br/>&nbsp; mount&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;/mpd&quot;<br/>&nbsp; password&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;ICECAST_SOURCE_PASSWORD&quot;<br/>&nbsp; bitrate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;128&quot;<br/>&nbsp; format&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;44100:16:2&quot;<br/>&nbsp; encoding&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;mp3&quot;<br/>}</pre>
	<p>This will stream to the icecast2 server on localhost:8000, using /mpd as mount point. The stream will be encoded
		on the fly to 16bit, 2 channel stereo mp3 at 128k bitrate.
	</p>

	<p>If you ran into the ipv6 warning before, you could alternatively solve that by setting an ipv4-only address:
	</p>
	<pre>bind_to_address &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;</pre>
	<p>Now restart MPD to reload the configuration:
	</p>
	<pre>$ sudo /etc/init.d/mpd restart</pre>
	<h3>Check if things are up an running</h3>

	<p>A new output should have been added and enabled:
	</p>
	<pre>$ mpc outputs <br/>Output 1 (My ALSA Device) is enabled<br/>Output 2 (RasPi MPD Stream) is enabled</pre>
	<p>If the stream output is disabled, you can enable it using:
	</p>
	<pre>$ mpc enable 2</pre>
	<p>Icecast2 should be running out of the box without any additional configuration.
	</p>

	<p>Check if both icecast2 and mpd are listening on tcp:
	</p>
	<pre>$ sudo netstat -ltpn<br/>Active Internet connections (only servers)<br/>Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foreign Address&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PID/Program name<br/>tcp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 0.0.0.0:8000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.0.0.0:*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LISTEN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1299/icecast2<br/>tcp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 127.0.0.1:6600&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.0.0.0:*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LISTEN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1734/mpd<br/>tcp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 0.0.0.0:22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.0.0.0:*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LISTEN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1531/sshd<br/>tcp6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 ::1:6600&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :::*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LISTEN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1734/mpd</pre>
	<h3>Start streaming</h3>

	<p>First you need to add a minimal playlist with a song. If neccessary, fix permissions for the music and playlist
		directories and check if your user (pi) is member of the audio group:
	</p>
	<pre>$ groups<br/>pi adm dialout cdrom sudo audio video plugdev games users input</pre>
	<p>If audio does not appear in this list, add it:
	</p>
	<pre>$ sudo usermod -a pi -G audio</pre>
	<p>Fix permissions:
	</p>
	<pre>$ sudo chmod g+w /var/lib/mpd/music/ /var/lib/mpd/playlists/<br/>$ sudo chgrp audio /var/lib/mpd/music/ /var/lib/mpd/playlists/</pre>
	<p>Now download a demo song:
	</p>
	<pre>$ cd /var/lib/mpd/music/<br/>$ wget http://www.jonobacon.org/files/freesoftwaresong/jonobacon-freesoftwaresong2.ogg</pre>
	<p>Add the song to the actual playlist:
	</p>
	<pre>$ mpc update<br/>$ mpc ls | mpc add<br/>$ mpc playlist<br/>Jono Bacon - Free Software Song </pre>
	<p>Enable repeat mode in the test phase to prevent MPD from stoping:
	</p>
	<pre>$ mpc repeat on<br/>volume: 80%&nbsp;&nbsp; repeat: on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; random: off&nbsp;&nbsp; single: off&nbsp;&nbsp; consume: off</pre>
	<p>Now start to play the song:
	</p>
	<pre>$ mpc play<br/>Jono Bacon - Free Software Song 2<br/>[playing] #1/1&nbsp;&nbsp; 0:00/3:18 (0%)<br/>volume: 80%&nbsp;&nbsp; repeat: on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; random: off&nbsp;&nbsp; single: off&nbsp;&nbsp; consume: off</pre>
	<p>If your speakers are connected, you should hear the song playing. Credits for the <a
			href="http://www.gnu.org/music/free-software-song.html" title="Free software sond" class="external-link">Free
		Software Song go to Richard Stallmann and Jono Bacon</a> ;-)
	</p>

	<p>Then open your browser and point it to your raspberry host on port 8000: !http://your.raspberry.hostname:8000/
		<br/>You should get the icecast status page with your stream at the mount point /mpd.
	</p>

	<p>If you navigate to http://your.raspberry.hostname:8000/mpd.m3u the browser should ask you to open the stream with
		your favorite music player. Have a look at the codec of the stream and notice that it's mp3 at 128k, although
		the original song is ogg at 160k. On-the-fly encoding is obviously working.
	</p>

	<p>Check your CPU usage using the top or htop command: it should be about 80%.
	</p>

	<h3>Which MPC clients to use?</h3>

	<p>If you have an Android smartphone, I suggest to use <a
			href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.namelessdev.mpdroid" title="MPD client for Android"
			class="external-link">MPDroid</a>.
	</p>

	<p>On the desktop I use <a href="http://sonata.berlios.de/" title="Lightweight MPD client" class="external-link">Sonata</a>,
		a lightweight GTK+ client written in Python.

				I'm using the built in httpd stream instead of icecast and the stream isn't exactly continuous, it keeps
				stopping and skipping. I think the reason is that mpd has to transcode the sound in realtime, which is
				probably to much to handle for the PI's cpu. Is there any other option that would allow to stream the
				sound in it's original format? I've got plenty of bandwidth, so that won't be a problem. I just won't to
				take that load off the CPU.

				I never used the builtin http streaming of mpd. AFAIK it also requires encoding, so you won't gain much
				performance here. I suggest to use raspbian, which ships hardfloat FPU support. This will reduce the
				load on your CPU significantly.<br/>

				Excellent stuff! Great tutorial. Appreciated.<br/>

				This actually stopped my DAC from crunching, one of the libraries must have fixed it. Before I installed

				Hi Nikola.<br/>
				<br/>
				Sticking to my setup, you would need an app for android which is capable of sending audio streams (e.g.
				http streams). On RasPi you could run icecast which receives the stream from android. A simple command
				line player (like mplayer) on RasPi could then connect to the icecast instance and play the stream.<br/>
				Unfortunately I don't know such an android app.<br/>
				<br/>
				There might be other ways to solve your need, for example with upnp. But I'm sorry I don't know much
				about this and can't help you.<br/>
				<br/>

				Brilliant tutorial, worked perfectly for me. As you mentioned, my RasPi's CPU is stuck at around 80%
				when I have mpd running in this configuration. I'd like to send multiple channels, and even do other
				things with the RasPi at the same time. Does anyone know of a way to reduce the CPU load? Perhaps by
				doing less or no processing on the sound files?
