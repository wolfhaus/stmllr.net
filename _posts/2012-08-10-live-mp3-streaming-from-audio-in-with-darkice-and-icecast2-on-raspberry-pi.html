title: Live mp3 streaming from audio-in with DarkIce and Icecast2 on Raspberry Pi
date: 2012-08-10 04:28
excerpt: As a response to my lastest article about Streaming audio with MPD and Icecast2 on Raspberry Pi, I was asked for some ideas about live streaming. I took the chance to plug in an usb audio device with microphone to RasPi and tried to get it working.

<section><p><b>Update (2012/08/11)</b>: Added a step to update package version number and added &quot;devscripts&quot;
	to the list of suggested packages .
</p>

	<h3>What you need to have</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Raspberry Pi with <a href="http://www.raspbian.org/RaspbianFAQ#What_is_Raspbian.3F"
								 title="What is Raspbian?" class="external-link">Raspbian</a> installed,
		</li>
		<li>USB sound stick with an input device,</li>
		<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/darkice/" title="What is darkice?" class="external-link">DarkIce</a> to
			capture audio from the audio input and send it to Icecast2,
		</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.icecast.org/" title="Icecase2" class="external-link">Icecast2</a> to distribute the
			audio stream.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Compiling and installing DarkIce</h3>

	<p>The default darkice package comes without mp3 support. Since mp3 is the most widespread codec, I decided to build
		my own package of darkice with mp3 support.
	</p>

	<p>Add a deb-src repository to your sources list at /etc/apt/sources.list:
	</p>
	<pre>$ sudo sh -c &quot;echo 'deb-src http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org/raspbian/ wheezy main contrib non-free rpi' &gt;&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list&quot;<br/>$ sudo apt-get update<br/>(...)</pre>
	<p>To fullfill the build dependencies, you have to install some additional packages:
	</p>
	<pre>$ sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install build-essential devscripts autotools-dev fakeroot dpkg-dev debhelper autotools-dev dh-make quilt ccache libsamplerate0-dev libpulse-dev libaudio-dev lame libjack-jackd2-dev libasound2-dev libtwolame-dev libfaad-dev libflac-dev libmp4v2-dev libshout3-dev libmp3lame-dev<br/>(...)</pre>
	<p>(Not sure if you need all these packages.&nbsp;But it won't hurt.)
	</p>

	<p>Create a working directory:
	</p>
	<pre>$ mkdir src &amp;&amp; cd src/</pre>
	<p>Get the source package of darkice:
	</p>
	<pre>$ apt-get source darkice<br/>(...)</pre>
	<p>Change the compile configuration to match Raspbian environment:
	</p>
	<pre>$ cd darkice-1.0/<br/>$ vi debian/rules</pre>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<pre>#!/usr/bin/make -f<br/><br/>%:<br/>	dh $@<br/><br/>.PHONY: override_dh_auto_configure<br/>override_dh_auto_configure:<br/>	ln -s /usr/share/misc/config.guess .<br/>	ln -s /usr/share/misc/config.sub .<br/>	dh_auto_configure -- --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/usr/share/doc/darkice/examples --with-vorbis-prefix=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/ --with-jack-prefix=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/ --with-alsa-prefix=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/ --with-faac-prefix=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/ --with-aacplus-prefix=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/ --with-samplerate-prefix=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/ --with-lame-prefix=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/ CFLAGS='-march=armv6 -mfpu=vfp -mfloat-abi=hard'</pre>
	<p>Please consider to <a href="/files/linux/rules" title="Initiates file download" class="download">download the
		rules file from here</a> instead of copy&amp;paste the lines above. The build will fail if line beginnings
		contains spaces instead of tabs.
	</p>

	<p>Before you start to build the package, change the version of the package to reflect mp3 support. debchange will
		ask you to add some comments to the changelog.
	</p>
	<pre>$ debchange -v 1.0-999~mp3+1<br/><br/>darkice (1.0-999~mp3+1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low<br/><br/>&nbsp; * New build with mp3 support<br/><br/>&nbsp;--&nbsp; &lt;pi@raspberrypi&gt;&nbsp; Sat, 11 Aug 2012 13:35:06 +0000</pre>
	<p>Build and install the darkice package:
	</p>
	<pre>$ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -b<br/>(...)<br/>$ sudo dpkg -i ../darkice_1.0-999~mp3+1_armhf.deb<br/>(...)<br/>Preparing to replace darkice 1.0-999 (using .../darkice_1.0-999~mp3+1_armhf.deb) ...<br/>Unpacking replacement darkice ...<br/>Setting up darkice (1.0-999~mp3+1) ...<br/>(...)</pre>
	<p>Now you have installed DarkIce&nbsp;with mp3 support.
	</p>

	<h3>Configuring DarkIce</h3>

	<p>Add a configuration by copying the template file:
	</p>
	<pre>$ sudo cp /usr/share/doc/darkice/examples/darkice.cfg /etc/</pre>
	<p>Here's an example configuration to have:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>read input from an usb device using the alsa audio device hw1,0</li>
		<li>stream mp3 output to an icecast2 server</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This is just an example and neither optimized nor secure! Learn more about darkice in the documentation section
		below /usr/share/doc/darkice/. The configuration options are explained in the manpage:
	</p>
	<pre>$ man darkice.cfg</pre>
	<p>Btw., to find your alsa input devices, ask arecord:
	</p>
	<pre>$ arecord -l<br/>**** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices ****<br/>card 1: U0x46d0x825 [USB Device 0x46d:0x825], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]<br/>&nbsp; Subdevices: 1/1<br/>&nbsp; Subdevice #0: subdevice #0</pre>
	<p>This particular input device is the microphone of a Logitech H270 webcam. It&nbsp;can be addressed using hw:1,0
		(Card 1, Subdevice 0).
	</p>

	<p>Keep in mind that Raspberry Pi has no input audio devices on board. You have to plug additional soundcard
		hardware to usb.
	</p>

	<h3>Installing Icecast2</h3>

	<p>If you don't have an icecast2 server running somewhere, you could set one up on RasPi.
	</p>
	<pre>$ sudo aptitude install icecast2</pre>
	<p>The package manager will ask you to configure Icecast2. You should do so and set a hostname and passwords for
		source, relay and administration. Needless to say to use strong passwords. The source password will be needed in
		the darkice.cfg configuration. (See SOURCE_PASSWORD in the above example)
	</p>

	<h3>Running DarkIce to stream audio</h3>
	<pre>$ darkice<br/>(...)<br/>Using config file: /etc/darkice.cfg<br/>Using ALSA DSP input device: hw:1,0<br/>Could not set POSIX real-time scheduling, this may cause recording skips.<br/>Try to run darkice as the super-user.</pre>
	<p>When you run into the following &quot;sink error&quot; message, check if icecast is running and passwords are
		matching:
	</p>
	<pre>DarkIce: LameLibEncoder.cpp:75: lame lib opening underlying sink error [0]</pre>
	<p>Now grab your favorite instrument and start a live jam.&nbsp;To listen to it, open your browser, navigate to the
		Raspberry Pi host at http://your.raspberry.hostname:8000/raspi and hook up into the stream with your favorite
		player.
	</p>

	<h3>Performance</h3>

	<p>I have done some very basic measurements. With the above configurations, the CPU load is about 50%. Very nice!

				hi, could I ask about audio input quality? <br/>
				<br/>
				I'm using arecord to get audio in from a usb device at plughw:1,0, but sound quality is not good. <br/>
				<br/>
				Are you getting good quality sound input? Are you using a USB hub?

				Hi tobie,<br/>
				<br/>
				I have a clear signal with my device. Whatever "clear" means to the microphone of my Logitech H270
				webcam ;-)<br/>
				The device is connected directly to one of the USB ports.<br/>
				<br/>
				Just a wild guess: the reason for your problem could be the samplerate.<br/>
				<br/>
				Try to find out which samplerate your device supports and then set ALSA accordingly.<br/>
				I had similar problems on a Seagate Dockstar with C-Media Audio USB Adapter. I fixed it by adding the
				following settings to /etc/asound.conf:<br/>
<pre><code>pcm.rate_convert {
	type plug
	slave {
		pcm "hw:1,0"
		rate 48000
	}
}</code></pre>

				Hi, <br/>
				<br/>
				How much delay is there in the recording (provided the pi and the listening device are on the same
				network)?<br/>
				I tried both RTP and HTTP Streaming successfully but with ~15s delay (no buffering used) and 30%
				CPU.<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>

				Hi Ben,<br/>
				<br/>
				mainly you have two buffers which need to get filled:<br/>
				<br/>
				1) Darkice buffer, configured with "bufferSecs" (5 seconds in my example cfg)<br/>
				2) Icecast2 buffer aka "queue-size" and eventually "burst-size>", which need some time to get
				filled.<br/>
				<br/>
				Not sure about how much delay is caused by resampling, but mpeg is not designed for low latency
				transport/transition. Maybe aac or ogg perform better here. I would be glad if you'd try and report back
				here.<br/>
				<br/>
				If you have both Darkice and icecast2 on one host, you can reduce the Darkice buffer. not sure if 0 is a
				good choice, but you could also try and frankly report here.<br/>
				However, if you want to provide a stable stream for clients on the network, you should not turn off
				icecast2 buffers completely.<br/>

			</p>

				Thanks for documenting this!<br/>
				<br/>
				What was the latency you experienced when listening on the same network? By latency, i mean the time
				between the moment a sound is recorded and the moment it is received on the remote device.<br/>
				<br/>
				Fyi, the best I have managed is ~15s. Not really real time...

			<p>
				I have experienced approx. the same 15 seconds.<br/>
				<br/>
				If you like to nail down the root of your latency, you could sniff the network traffic e.g. with
				wireshark. Then you should roughly see how much time goes by until darkice starts streaming to
				icecast.<br/>
				<br/>
				Latency is nothing unusual for consumer (aka "mp3") audio streams in the internet.

				Have you done any load testing with actual users connected? I wonder how many listeners the RPi could
				handle..

			<p>
				Though I haven't tested this, I guess the network would be the bottleneck.<br/>
				<br/>
				RPi has only a network capacity of 100MBit/s, which theoretically means approx. 800 concurrent listeners
				with a 128k stream. This does not consider any overhead caused by network protocols and the ones.<br/>
				<br/>
				If you like to test this, have a look at this article, including a basic test script:
				http://www.icecast.org/loadtest1.php<br/>

				by the way this is what my asound.conf looks like - not sure what most of it means tho:<br/>
				<br/>
				pcm.mmap0 {<br/>
				type mmap_emul;<br/>
				slave {<br/>
				pcm "hw:0,0";<br/>
				}<br/>

				My sound is sort of chunky, here's a sample: http://cl.ly/0y0n3y2q1g04 (the static noise is on purpose,
				notice it clips a few times every second).<br/>
				<br/>
				I've tried sample rates 44100, 48000 and 22050. 48000 seems to yield the best result, but still has that
				clipping.<br/>
				<br/>
				Also tried that asound.conf stuff. Tried different bufferSecs like 5, 10, 15... but no luck...<br/>
				<br/>
				I'm using a Behringer UCA200.<br/>
				<br/>
				Any thoughts?

				Thank you so much for this guide. My only problem is that darkice seems to crash after a while, still

				<br/>
				My question is how to add this to the boot initialization. I went through a couple forums and blogs on

				Hi, great tutorial.<br/>
				<br/>
				I'm getting the right message from darkice as you can see below.<br/>
				However at the icecast level, after opening the URL ao don't hear anything. Its necessary to use

				<br/>
				I want to stream audio directly from my webcam. I tested with aplay and is working fine.<br/>
				<br/>
				Help me please.<br/>

				Hi Pedro,<br/>
				<br/>
				using arecord is not necessary here. Darkice directly fetches the input signal and streams it to
				icecast2.<br/>
				<br/>
				Can you see your stream in icecast2 when you open http://your.raspberry.hostname:8000/raspi in your

				<br/>
				If so, then make sure, you have configured the correct device in darkice.cfg as given from arecord
				-l<br/>
				<br/>
				[input]<br/>
				device = hw:1,0<br/>
				<br/>
				Maybe you setting hw:1,0 instead of plughw:1,0 helps.<br/>
				<br/>
				If your stream is not shown up in icecast2 at all, then check if mountpoint, password and url in the
				darkice AND icecast2 configuration match.<br/>
				icecast2 configuration can be found in /etc/icecast2/icecast.xml<br/>
				Also have a look at the log from icecast2. could be that the logging needs to be turned on first. This
				is also configured in the config file mentioned above.

				Hi Steffen,<br/>
				<br/>
				thanks for publishing this HowTo. Almost everyone should be able to follow the instructions on this
				page. <br/>
				<br/>
				I wanted to stream music - especially my CD collection - from my raspberry to my local network without
				first converting the CD's to MP3 files. I have a Sonos network and a NOXON radio which work well with
				this solution. <br/>
				<br/>
				For me this is the perfect solution:<br/>
				<br/>
				audio CD - Player is connected to a behringer_ufo_202 audio interface which is connected to my
				raspberry. At first I tried to use a cheap usb-soundcard which was mono and has a very bad sampling
				quality. After connecting the Behringer Interface, I had a clear sound sampling. Any other good
				interface will do the same I think. For Vinyl samplings this one has a audio pre amplifier built in. Do
				not waste time with poor audio equipment. I will test audio quality with a 96 Khz sampling rate soon.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				One word to the configuration: You should set<br/>
				<br/>
				pcm.rate_convert {<br/>
				type plug<br/>
				slave {<br/>
				pcm "hw:1,0"<br/>
				rate 48000<br/>
				}<br/>
				}<br/>
				<br/>
				So now I can automatically stream every sound input to my network and connect any streaming client to
				the raspberry Icecast server.

				Hi Steffen,<br/>
				<br/>
				What a great tutorial! I have been running Darkice on Single Board Computer and now want to try the same
				on a Rasp Pi. After following your tutorial, I get the following information when trying to start
				Darkice on the Rasp Pi;<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Using config file: /etc/darkice.cfg<br/>
				Using ALSA DSP input device: hw:1,0<br/>
				Using POSIX real-time scheduling, priority 98<br/>
				DarkIce: TcpSocket.cpp:251: connect error [111]<br/>
				<br/>
				Can you suggest what I am missing?<br/>
				<br/>
				If you need more information like the config file, then let me know.<br/>
				<br/>
				Thanks!<br/>

				Hi teratech,<br/>
				<br/>
				seems like Darkice is not able to connect with your Icecast2 server. Check server and port settings in
				the [icecast2-0] section of the Darkice config file.<br/>
				<br/>
				And also test if icecast2 is running and accepting incoming TCP connections on the specified host
				address/port.<br/>
				<br/>
<pre><code>$ sudo netstat -ltpn | grep icecast2

Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address Foreign Address State PID/Program name
tcp 0 0 xx.xx.xx.xx:8000 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 1751/icecast2</code></pre>

				Hey Steffen,<br/>
				Thanks for the quick reply. I tried to run the netstat command but nothing came back. Then it struck me
				that your instruction were to install both Darkice and Icecast on a Rasp Pi. When using the SBC I also
				had an external server running Icecast2. I am using the same configuration information to point Darkice
				on the Rasp Pi to the external server. I am using the same server, port, password and mountPoint as I
				used on the SBC which connects to the Icecast server without an issue. Is there another way to check the
				Rasp Pi connectivity to the remote server? Am I catching all the important network configuration
				information with server, port, password and mountPoint data?<br/>
				<br/>
				Here is the config file data for server connection:<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				bitrateMode = abr # average bit rate<br/>
				format = mp3 # format of the stream: mp3<br/>
				bitrate = 128 # bitrate of the stream sent to the server<br/>
				server = 66.55.xxx.xx # host name of the server<br/>
				port = 80xx # port of the IceCast2 server, usually 8000<br/>
				password = xxxxxxxx # source password to the IceCast2 server<br/>
				mountPoint = live # mount point of this stream on the IceCast2 server<br/>
				<br/>
				I deeply appreciate your assistance! teratech

				Hey Steffen,<br/>
				<br/>
				I figured what the problem was. I needed to comment out the additional options in the config file that
				were below the Icecast2 examples. I am referring to the shoutcast and Icecast parts of the example
				config file. So Darkice is working on the Rasp Pi for me now. Thanks again for your help and tutorial!

				Thanks for this guide, definitely saved me a ton of time.<br/>
				<br/>
				I just wanted to comment that the single snafu I ran into was in creating the debian/rules file.<br/>
				<br/>
				If you copy and paste the provided code into the file, there's the danger of the tabs being converted
				into spaces, which results in a "missing separator" error when you go to compile the source, which will
				probably look like this:<br/>
				<br/>
				debian/rules:4: *** missing separator. Stop.<br/>
				<br/>
				To remedy, you just need to delete all spaces at the beginning of lines, but make sure there is a single
				tab at the front of every line that follows a colon.<br/>
				<br/>
				I'm mentioning this so that this page will be searchable for that error and so people will know how to
				deal with it. :)<br/>
				<br/>
				Cheers and thanks again.

				Thanks for the tutorial! So far seems good, got Icecast2 and darkice running. However, there doesn't
				seem to be any audio from the microphone. <br/>
				<br/>
				I am using an XLR to USB cable so I have a feeling that it isn't amplifying the sound from the mic

				<br/>
				I have turned everything up in the alsamixer so I have a feeling I just need a different type of input
				device. Can anyone give me a suggestion on what devices they are connecting to RPi for audio input?<br/>

				Steffen, <br/>
				Thanks for your step-by-step explanation. It is really helpful.<br/>
				I like to use the darkice part only. Download and building all went well until the 'sudo dpkg -i
				../darkice_1.0-999~mp3+1_armhf.deb' statement. Actually that went well too, but no darkice binary in
				/usr/bin ............ (I presume it should be there?)<br/>
				Also no cfg file, since there is no Examples dir in the existing /usr/share/docs/darkice dir.<br/>
				<br/>
				The exact output of the 'sudo dpkg' statement was this (differs from your example):<br/>
				Selecting previously unselected package darkice.<br/>
				(Reading database ... 62652 files and directories currently installed.)<br/>
				Unpacking darkice (from .../darkice_1.0-999~mp3+1_armhf.deb) ...<br/>
				Setting up darkice (1.0-999~mp3+1) ...<br/>
				pi@raspberry $<br/>
				<br/>
				What is going wrong here ?<br/>
				<br/>
				Canyou shed some light in my darkness?<br/>
				Kind regards,<br/>
				Arnold

				Hi Arnold,<br/>
				<br/>
				to see the files of a package try:<br/>
				<br/>
				$ dpkg -L darkice<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				AFAIK the package does not ship a default configuration file.

				I found the reason: no tab nor space before the dh_auto_configure statement in debian/rules!<br/>
				That was clearly not allowed. <br/>
				<br/>
				But right now it has recompiled (with the tab in debian/rules), and I expect it to work now. Building
				gives way more output than the first try.<br/>
				Builds successful, and after dpkg -i there is a /usr/bin/darkice and even an example.cfg !<br/>
				Thanks for your time,<br/>
				Arnold<br/>
				<br/>
				Btw: dpkg -L darkice yielded this (without the tab):<br/>
				/.<br/>
				/etc/defaults<br/>

				@JJ.... Sounds like you missed something (even if you did it all twice).. because I did this on a RasPi
				with wheezy and darkice is working great. (I did not install icecast). I got that error before I added

				Hey again,<br/>
				<br/>
				Was able to get sound to come through using a mixer with phantom power. However, there is high amounts
				of distortion when talking into the mic. I'm using an XLR to USB adapter and I think it is causing the
				distortion (I tried every sample rate and messed with options in darkice.cfg for awhile). What kinds of
				setups are you guys using to live stream to the raspberry pi usb input?<br/>

				Can you please rebuild the package and have a look, if the output of the <em>"configure"</em> part
				contains: <em>"build with aacplus library"</em><br/>
				<br/>
				If you this output, than I'd say it's a bug which needs to be fixed in darkice and then backported to
				the debian src package.<br/>
				<br/>
				If you get <em>"building without aacplus"</em> or <em>"not found, building without aacplus"</em>, then
				you probably miss some package dependency. If you'd post the corresponding aacplus lines (please NOT the
				complete output) I could have a look.<br/>

				Hi Steffen. Thank you for the fast answer! These are the errors I get:<br/>
				checking for faac library at /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/ ... configure: WARNING: not found, building
				without faac<br/>
				checking for aacplus library at /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/ ... configure: WARNING: not found,
				building without aacplus<br/>
				<br/>
				How can that be fixed?

				Hi Michael M,<br/>
				<br/>
				you probably miss the libaacplus packages (and libfaac). Unfortunately they are not available in the
				Raspbian distribution.<br/>
				<br/>
				You could instead install them from http://www.deb-multimedia.org/ Since this resource doesn't support
				special builds for RasPi (aka hardfloat) chances are that you end up in performance problems while
				encoding. But you should give it a try. After the installation you have to rebuild darkice as described
				in the article above.<br/>
				<br/>
				I tried to, but darkice failed to compile with error<br/>
				<em>aacPlusEncoder.h:45:30: fatal error: libaacplus/cfftn.h: No such file or directory</em><br/>
				<br/>
				I gave up since it would take too much time to debug and fix it.

				Hi Steffen,<br/>
				<br/>
				Your tutorial is fantastic, much appreciated. <br/>
				<br/>
				One problem I've encounter though: Im using a headless RasPi on a hardwired ethernet connection and a
				cheap USB sound card, but when I start streaming the audio I get this strange choppy/glitchy sound
				(other than that, it would sound pretty good). I thought it might be the darkice.cfg or the
				AlsaDspSource.cpp buffers - i tried increasing both by 5 secs, but no go. I also tried using 64kpbs,
				varying sample rates, low quality, mono channel etc...am I missing something here?<br/>
				<br/>
				You're help would be much appreciated!

				Jason, the reason could be samplerate and alsa configuration. But I am not a pro when it comes to
				hardware configuration and alsa, so I'd suggest you to ask google for help :)

				Hi Thierry,<br/>
				<br/>
				did you set "format" in your /etc/darkice.cfg file as shown in the example?<br/>
<pre><code>[icecast2-0]
...
format = mp3
...</code></pre>
			<br/>
			If setting format does not fix your issue, please post your darkice.cfg file to <a
				href="http://pastebin.com">http://pastebin.com</a> or the like and add the link here. <br/>

				I have followed all the steps and compiled the binary. But after I install the package the binary is not
				to be found:<br/>
				<br/>
				johan@raspberrypi ~/src/darkice-1.0 $ sudo dpkg -i ../darkice_1.0-999~mp3+1_armhf.deb<br/>
				Selecting previously unselected package darkice.<br/>
				(Reading database ... 62619 files and directories currently installed.)<br/>
				Unpacking darkice (from .../darkice_1.0-999~mp3+1_armhf.deb) ...<br/>
				Setting up darkice (1.0-999~mp3+1) ...<br/>
				<br/>
				When I try to tab complete I only get the existing commands, not darkice:<br/>
				<br/>
				johan@raspberrypi ~/src/darkice-1.0 $ da<br/>
				dash date<br/>
				<br/>
				During compilation and installation of the package there are no critical errors whatsoever. What could I
				be doing wrong?

				@Thierry<br/>
				<br/>
				It seems your darkice.cfg is incomplete or wrong. Your posted configuration does not cause the error you
				mentioned before:<br/>
<pre><code>DarKice: configSection.ccp 117: format missing in section icecast-0 [0]</code></pre>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			In your post, you have [icecast2-0] instead of icecast-0<br/>
			<br/>
			Please double check is you use the coorect cfg file. You could try to explicitly set it with:<br/>
<pre><code>darkice -c /path/to/your/darkice.cfg</code></pre>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Also you the bitrateMode requires you to set bitrate or quality: <br/>
			<br/>
			If you use <br/>
<pre><code>bitrateMode = vbr</code></pre>
			<br/>
			then you have to set quality instead of bitrate. So either you switch to something like:<br/>
<pre><code>bitrateMode = cbr
format = mp3
bitrate = 128
</code></pre>
			<br/>
			or:<br/>
<pre><code>bitrateMode = vbr
format = mp3
quality = 0.6</code></pre>
			<br/>
