My name is Steffen Müller and I'm a software architect and developer at <a href="http://gebruederheitz.de/" class="/gebrüderheitz">/gebrüderheitz</a> in Freiburg, Germany.
I'm contributing to several open source projects, mainly TYPO3 CMS.

Others call me: <a href="http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/" title="BDD Introduction by Dan North" class="external-link">Behavior-Driven Development</a> addict,
IT security paranoid
and even <a href="https://typo3.org/news/article/typo3-cms-60-end-of-life-announcement/" title="6.0 contributor credits by Helmut Hummel" class="external-link">skeptical perfectionist</a>.
I appreciate the spirit of free source communities.
All that gets reflected on twitter via <a href="https://twitter.com/stmllr" title="Steffen Müller on twitter" class="external-link-new-window">@stmllr</a> and on <a href="https://github.com/stmllr/" title="Steffen Müller on github" class="external-link-new-window">github</a>

## At work...

My daily work covers:

**Requirement analysis**: focusing on customer needs to build the right things - applying agile methods, like user stories, modeling by example and rapid prototyping.

**Consulting**: Analysis and evaluation of software architecture and quality, for example structural code analysis, basic security audits and performance tests.

**Planning**: Creating technical concepts and deciding on tools, processes and approaches, for example Domain Driven Design.

**Software Architecture & development**: Creating sustainable yet pragmatic solutions, based on object oriented software. Refactoring, continuous development and&nbsp;design patterns are basic parts of that.

**Quality assurance**: Applied Test Driven Development with PHPUnit and Behavior Driven Development with Behat/Mink + Selenium, from unit tests over functional tests to full blown acceptance tests.

**Continuous Delivery**: Developing continuous integration infrastructures.


## Open Source: TYPO3 active contributor

My first contact with the TYPO3 community was in 2002. Many years later, in 2013, I became an official <a href="http://typo3.org/teams/core-development-team/roles-groups/" title="Roles and group in the TYPO3 CMS project" class="external-link">active contributor</a> of the TYPO3 core with merge rights. I have been a member of the <a href="http://typo3.org/teams/security/" title="The security team pages on typo3.org" class="external-link">TYPO3 security team</a> from 2004-2008. Additionally I maintain and develop several <a href="http://forge.typo3.org/users/348" title="My user account at TYPO3 forge" class="external-link">community extensions</a>.

The <a href="http://typo3.org/" title="The content management system TYPO3" class="external-link">Open Source CMS TYPO3</a> is my favorite tool for&nbsp;content management. It combines enterprise level features with a well networked, highly active and progressive open source community.
